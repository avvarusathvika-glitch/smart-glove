# smart-glove
This project presents a Smart Gesture Recognition Glove that detects predefined hand gestures and converts them into text or speech via a mobile application. The glove is embedded with motion and flex sensors that track gestures, process them through a microcontroller, and wirelessly transmit the data to a smartphone.
